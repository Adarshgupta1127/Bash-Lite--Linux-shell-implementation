# 🖥️ Bash Lite – Linux Shell Implementation

A lightweight Linux shell implemented in **C** that replicates essential features of the UNIX shell.  
This project demonstrates low-level system programming concepts, process management, and command execution using system calls.

---

## 📌 Features
- **Command Execution**: Run system commands directly from the shell (e.g., `ls`, `pwd`, `cat`).
- **Background Execution**: Support for running commands in the background using `&`.
- **Built-in Commands**: Implemented core shell commands like `cd`, `exit`, and `help`.
- **System Call Integration**: Utilized `fork()`, `execvp()`, and `wait()` for process creation and handling.
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid commands or failed executions.
